<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I, MAJ (FR) JESSIE B GECAIN CHS, was ordained priest last June 10, 2008, by the late His Eminence Ricardo J Cardinal Vidal, D.D. 
  at Cebu Metropolitan Cathedral. At that time, I belonged to Maryâ€™s Little Children Community (MLCC). On March 2009, 
  I left MLCC after it suffered a crisis and joined the splinter-group, the Community of the Salt and Light of Christ (CSLC). 
  While at CSLC, I had served as a missionary priest in the Diocese of Sibu, Sarawak, Malaysia, from March 2009 until 
  our community was dissolved last April 2, 2014. While serving in the Diocese of Sibu, I was designated by 
  Most Rev Joseph Hii Teck Kwong, Bishop of the Diocese of Sibu as Chairman of the Commission of Social Communications and Mass Media.</p>

<p>Prior for my re-entry program in the Archdiocese of Cebu, I had finished my Certificate Program in Filmmaking on October 25, 2014 
  at the International Academy of Film and Television, Mactan, Cebu. On December 2014, I was sent to Bantayan Island for the start of 
  my re-entry program under the guidance of Msgr Vicente Rey Penagunda and supervision of Msgr Alfredo Romanillos. While being there, 
  I was able to make three short films, uploaded in my YouTube Channel  <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/@direk_among">Direk Among</a>, 
  namely, <a href="https://youtu.be/t83l7mXY6Us">"Binilanggo sa Kagahapon"</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/e0qB1lAjocU">"When Her Rights Went Wrong"</a> 
  and <a href="https://youtu.be/fYoy0othuuQ">"Dinagkotang Pangandoy"</a>.</p>

<p>During the 51st International Eucharistic Congress in Cebu, I met the PAF Chaplain delegates, and was recruited to join the Chaplain Service. 
  With the endorsement of Bishop Leopoldo S Tumulak D.D., and the recommendation of Archbishop Jose S Palma, D.D., thanks be to God, 
  I am now serving as PAF Chaplain under your paternal care and guidance of the MOST REVEREND OSCAR JAIME L FLORENCIO, D.D, SThD, 
  Bishop of the Military Ordinariate of the Philippines.</p>

  <p>At present, I am now the Base Chaplain of 540th Air Base Group, Basa Air Base, Floridablanca, Pampanga. I serve here since March 2022. 
  Since then, with the help of the Chapel Pastoral Council, I have done four short films, namely: <a href="https://youtu.be/aspQjpj-V3w">"Munting Dalangin, Munting Pangarap,"</a>  
  <a href="https://youtu.be/5AtER8Me1Zk">"Sapagkat Tao Lamang,"</a> <a href="https://youtu.be/opYnKwd511g">"Mga Mukha ng Pag-ibig,"</a>  and <a href="https://youtu.be/a6GiEkA2lco">"Sa Kandungan ng Nanay"</a>.</p>

  <p>With my previous experiences in the field of Social Communications and Mass Media, and with my interest and basic skills in filmmaking, 
    I now explore my interests in Web Development, to hopefully serve better in the area of Social Communications.</p>

  <p>May Almighty God bless my every endeavour for our good and for His Greater Glory. Amen.</p>

  <p>Thank you very much.</p>
  <p>God bless. Ave Maria!</p>
